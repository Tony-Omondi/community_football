# Community Football Management System - MVP

## Overview

A Django-based system to manage local football tournaments, teams, players, matches, and standings in a community. The system focuses on centralizing leagues and tournaments, allowing fans to register, coaches to manage teams and players, and league officials/admins to oversee tournaments.

## Features (MVP)

* Fan registration and login
* Admin creates Coaches and League Officials
* Coaches can create Players (future)
* Teams and Tournaments management
* User roles with permissions
* JWT-based authentication

## API Endpoints (so far)

| Method | Endpoint               | Role          | Description              |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |

## Challenges Faced

* Setting up custom User model with multiple roles
* Handling foreign keys for teams and tournaments before those apps existed
* Fixing reverse accessor conflicts with Django's default `auth.User`

## Next Steps

* Create Coach dashboard to register Players
* Implement Team and Tournament management APIs
* Add Match scheduling and Standings computation
* Add permissions for Admin, Coaches, and League Officials
